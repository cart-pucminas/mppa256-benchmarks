Single-Cluster Version of CAP Benchmarks for MPPA-256
======================================================

What Is This Project About?
---------------------------

This project delivers a narrowed version of the [CAP
Benchmarks](https://github.com/cart-pucminas/CAPBenchmarks) suite for
the MPPA-256 manycore processor. In this version, application kernels
of the original benchmark suite were re-dimensioned to target a single
compute cluster and some additional synthetic/application kernels were
added. Currently the following kernels are available:

* MM: Naive Matrix Multiplication
* GF: Gaussian Filter
* TSP: Travelling Salesman Problem
* FPU: Floating Point Unit Stress
